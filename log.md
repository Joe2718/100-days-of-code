### Day 1: Dec 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I set this up and am going to test to see if this sync's.  

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after alot of attempts and hours spent.  <== from the original guy.  I think the algorithm's are right around the corner and I'm looking forward to it although a couple projects probably first.  
Now to figure out how to delete the other one I created.  The learning curve sometimes feels like a learning wall that I'm beating my head against.  A paper wall cause i'm done already!
