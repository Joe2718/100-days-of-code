### Day 1: Dec 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I set this up and am going to test to see if this sync's.  

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after alot of attempts and hours spent.  <== from the original guy.  I think the algorithm's are right around the corner and I'm looking forward to it although a couple projects probably first.  
Now to figure out how to delete the other one I created.  The learning curve sometimes feels like a learning wall that I'm beating my head against.  A paper wall cause i'm done already!
OK, i'm going to make just a little more change and do this once more.  
Changed files get "git add file" to put them into the que to be sync'd.  There's got to be an automatic way instead of manually doing this.  Hrm.. so my current process.
git add log.md
git commit -m "It works"    <-- it works is better than wtf when I must have mistyped something.
